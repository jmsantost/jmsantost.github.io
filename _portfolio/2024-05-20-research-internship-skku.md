During my research stay at the **RISE Lab** at **Sungkyunkwan University** in South Korea, I worked under the supervision of **Nabih Pico, Ph.D.**. This experience allowed me to dive deep into the field of mobile robotics, focusing on autonomous navigation and mapping.

### Technical Research & Development
My work focused on implementing and testing **Navigation** and **SLAM** (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) architectures. I utilized a professional robotics stack to bridge the gap between simulation and real-world deployment:

* **Platforms:** Worked extensively with **TurtleBot3**.
* **Software Stack:** Developed using **ROS (Robot Operating System)** and **RViz** for data visualization.
* **Simulation:** Conducted experiments and validation in **Gazebo**.
* **Specific Algorithms:** Optimized industrial motion planning and SLAM architectures, including collaboration with **Hyundai Robotics**.

### Lab Experiments & Demonstrations
The following videos showcase the implementation of autonomous navigation stacks and sensor fusion experiments conducted during the internship:

### Professional Impact
This internship was not only a technical challenge but also an enriching cultural and academic exchange. I gained significant experience in:
* **Human-Robot Interaction:** Modeling navigation scenarios using **Social Force Models (SFM)**.
* **International Collaboration:** Engaging with high-level researchers and industrial partners.
