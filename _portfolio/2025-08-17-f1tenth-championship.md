### Technical Overview
The competition required the vehicle to complete multiple laps on an indoor track autonomously, with judges monitoring times and lap counts. Our team, **AIROS**, developed a robust navigation stack to handle high-speed maneuvers while maintaining safety.

* **Perception:** Integrated LiDAR-based SLAM to map the environment in real-time.
* **Navigation:** Implemented reactive algorithms (Gap Follower) to optimize the racing line.
* **Control:** Fine-tuned PID controllers for precise steering and velocity control using **ROS 2**.

### Race Highlights
The vehicle successfully completed seven laps, reaching the finish line and stopping automatically as part of the tiebreak criteria.

### Team and Leadership
As a former President of the **AIROS Club**, leading this project allowed me to bridge the gap between academic research in swarm robotics and practical, competitive application.
