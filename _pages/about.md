I am **José Miguel Santos Terán**, a Mechatronics Engineer from **ESPOL** (Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral). I am passionate about robotics research, control systems, and engineering education.

Currently, I serve as a **Mechatronics Teaching Technician** at **Universidad Politécnica Salesiana (UPS)** in Guayaquil, Ecuador.

## Research & Projects
My primary research focus is **Swarm Robotics**. I am currently working on replicating and extending research papers in this field, utilizing the **ARGoS simulator** to analyze collective robotic behaviors and learning functions.

## Teaching Experience
At UPS, I am responsible for practical laboratory instruction, working with industrial robotic platforms such as the **KUKA KR10** and **KR4**. I also teach courses related to **CAD/CAM** software, including:
* **SolidWorks** (Certification in progress)
* **Autodesk Inventor**
* **Mastercam**

## Leadership
I previously served as the **President of the AIROS** (Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Society) at ESPOL, where I organized technical events and fostered a community for robotics enthusiasts.

## Goals
I am actively seeking a **PhD position** to deepen my expertise in autonomous systems and decentralized control. I aim to contribute to the development of robust robotic swarms for complex real-world applications.
