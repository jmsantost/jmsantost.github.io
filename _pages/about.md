I am José Miguel Santos Terán, a Mechatronics Engineer from ESPOL (Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral). I am passionate about robotics, control systems, and engineering education, with hands-on experience in designing, simulating, and implementing control strategies for complex robotic systems.

Currently, I serve as a Mechatronics Teaching Technician at Universidad Politécnica Salesiana (UPS) in Guayaquil, Ecuador, where I guide students in laboratory sessions and practical projects related to control and robotics.

## Research & Projects
My primary research focus is Control Systems. I am working on replicating and extending research papers in this field, utilizing ARGoS and ROS/Gazebo simulators to analyze collective robotic behaviors and implement learning-based control functionalities.

My thesis project involves QUPA, a modular robotic platform, where I contributed to the mechanical, electronic, and control design of both the robot and its gripper. This includes:
* Designing control architectures for gripper manipulation and robotic motion.
* Implementing PID and state-space control strategies.
* Simulating system behavior under decentralized and hierarchical control.
* Validating performance and stability through time- and frequency-domain analysis.

These projects integrate mechanics, electronics, control theory, and simulation, giving me a strong foundation for research in diagnostics and monitoring of interconnected systems.

## Teaching Experience
At UPS, I am responsible for practical laboratory instruction, working with industrial robotic platforms such as the KUKA KR10 and KR4, and teaching CAD/CAM software, including:
* SolidWorks
* Autodesk Inventor
* Mastercam

Previously, as a Teaching Assistant at ESPOL, I supported courses on Applied Control Systems and Mechatronic Design, where I taught:
* State-space modeling and transfer function analysis.
* PID controllers and control implementation.
* Stability analysis, including Lyapunov criteria and H-infinity control.
* Time- and frequency-domain analysis, including Bode and Nyquist diagrams.

## Leadership
I previously served as President of AIROS (Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Society) at ESPOL, organizing technical workshops, competitions, and community events to promote robotics research.

## Goals
I am actively seeking a PhD position to deepen my expertise in autonomous systems, complex systems, control theory, and decentralized control, aiming to develop robust robotic swarms and intelligent systems for complex real-world applications.
