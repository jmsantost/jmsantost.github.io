I am **José Miguel Santos Terán**, a Mechatronics Engineer from **ESPOL** (Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral)[cite: 1, 51]. I am passionate about robotics, control systems, and engineering education, with hands-on experience in designing, simulating, and implementing control strategies for complex robotic systems[cite: 5, 6].

Currently, I serve as a **Mechatronics Teaching Technician** at **Universidad Politécnica Salesiana (UPS)** in Guayaquil, Ecuador, where I guide students in laboratory sessions and practical projects related to control and robotics[cite: 36, 40].

## Research & Projects
My primary research focus is **Swarm Robotics and Interconnected Dynamical Systems**[cite: 5, 6]. I am working on replicating and extending research papers in this field, utilizing **ARGoS** and **ROS/Gazebo** simulators to analyze collective robotic behaviors and implement learning-based control functionalities[cite: 21, 24].

My thesis project involves **QUPA**, a modular robotic platform, where I contributed to the mechanical, electronic, and control design of both the robot and its gripper[cite: 17, 25]. This includes:
* **Designing control architectures** for gripper manipulation and robotic motion[cite: 25, 33].
* **Implementing PID and state-space control** strategies[cite: 46, 49].
* **Simulating system behavior** under decentralized and hierarchical control[cite: 6, 49].
* **Validating performance and stability** through time- and frequency-domain analysis.

These projects integrate mechanics, electronics, control theory, and simulation, giving me a strong foundation for research in diagnostics and monitoring of interconnected systems.

## Teaching Experience
At **UPS**, I am responsible for practical laboratory instruction, working with industrial robotic platforms such as the **KUKA KR10 and KR4**, and teaching **CAD/CAM** software[cite: 37, 42], including:
* **SolidWorks**
* **Autodesk Inventor**
* **Mastercam**

Previously, as a **Teaching Assistant at ESPOL**, I supported courses on **Applied Control Systems** and **Mechatronic Design**[cite: 43, 46], where I taught:
* **State-space modeling** and transfer function analysis[cite: 46, 49].
* **PID controllers** and control implementation[cite: 46].
* **Stability analysis**, including **Lyapunov criteria** and **H-infinity control**.
* **Time- and frequency-domain analysis**, including Bode and Nyquist diagrams.

## Leadership
I previously served as **President of AIROS** (Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Society) at ESPOL, organizing technical workshops, competitions, and community events to promote robotics research.

## Goals
I am actively seeking a **PhD position** to deepen my expertise in autonomous systems, control theory, and decentralized control, aiming to develop robust robotic swarms and intelligent systems for complex real-world applications.
