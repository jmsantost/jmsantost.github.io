I am José Miguel Santos Terán, a Mechatronics Engineer from Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral (ESPOL). My research interests lie in Control Systems, nonlinear dynamics, and decentralized coordination in multi-agent robotic systems.

My work focuses on the development of distributed control strategies for swarm robotics, integrating theoretical control foundations with large-scale simulation and hardware validation. I am particularly interested in stability analysis, state-space modeling, and learning-based coordination mechanisms for autonomous robotic collectives.

## Research Focus

My research centers on:

- Nonlinear control and stability analysis (Lyapunov-based methods, H-infinity control)
- Decentralized and distributed control architectures
- Multi-agent coordination and swarm robotics
- Learning-based task allocation mechanisms
- Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop validation using ARGoS, ROS2, and Gazebo

## QUPA Robotic Platform

My thesis project involves the development of QUPA, a modular robotic platform designed for swarm construction research. I contributed to the mechanical, electronic, and control system design of both the robotic base and its gripper mechanism.

My work includes:

- Designing control architectures for robotic motion and manipulation
- Implementing PID and state-space controllers
- Modeling system dynamics and validating stability properties
- Evaluating system performance in time and frequency domains
- Simulating decentralized and hierarchical coordination strategies

This project bridges theoretical control modeling with physical robotic implementation, strengthening my research foundation in interconnected dynamical systems.

## Academic & Teaching Experience

Alongside my research activities, I serve as a Mechatronics Teaching Technician at Universidad Politécnica Salesiana (UPS), where I supervise laboratory sessions in industrial robotics and control systems. I work with platforms such as KUKA KR10/KR4 and guide students in modeling, controller implementation, and system validation.

Previously, as a Teaching Assistant at ESPOL, I supported courses in Advanced Control Systems and Mechatronic Design, covering:

- State-space modeling and transfer function analysis
- Controller design and implementation
- Stability analysis (Lyapunov methods, H-infinity control)
- Time- and frequency-domain techniques (Bode and Nyquist analysis)

## Research Objectives

I am actively seeking a PhD position in Control Systems and Complex Dynamical Systems, with a focus on decentralized multi-agent coordination, swarm robotics, and stability analysis of interconnected autonomous systems.
