I am José Miguel Santos Terán, a Mechatronics Engineer specializing in distributed autonomous robotic systems, swarm robotics, and embedded control. My work integrates hardware design, multi-level simulation, perception, and decentralized coordination in resource-constrained robotic platforms.

I am currently a Mechatronics Teaching Technician at Universidad Politécnica Salesiana (UPS), where I supervise laboratory sessions in robotics and control systems. Alongside my teaching responsibilities, I actively develop experimental robotic platforms focused on cooperative task execution and scalable swarm behaviors.

## Research Focus

My research interests lie at the intersection of:

- Distributed autonomous control  
- Swarm and multi-robot systems  
- Multi-level simulation of collective behaviors  
- Resource-constrained embedded robotic platforms  
- Decentralized perception and decision-making under uncertainty  

I am particularly interested in understanding how locally sensing and computing robots can coordinate at scale to achieve reliable inspection, monitoring, and cooperative manipulation tasks.

## Selected Project — QUPA Distributed Robotic Platform

QUPA is a modular miniaturized robotic platform designed for cooperative manipulation and swarm-based task execution. The project involved:

- Mechatronic design of a compact manipulation module  
- Embedded implementation using ESP32-based architecture  
- Energy modeling and torque analysis for resource-constrained operation  
- Decentralized perception using onboard vision processing  
- Multi-robot simulation experiments in ARGoS and Gazebo  
- Experimental validation with physical robots  

Through scaling experiments (1–3 robots), I analyzed task completion time and efficiency improvements, demonstrating measurable performance gains emerging from decentralized coordination.

This work combines mechanical design, control theory, embedded systems, perception, and swarm-level simulation — forming the foundation of my research trajectory in distributed autonomous robotics.
