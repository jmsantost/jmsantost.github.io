Executive Summary
======
Mechatronics Engineer focused on Advanced Control Systems, Swarm Robotics, and Autonomous Navigation. I have a background in international research at Sungkyunkwan University (South Korea) in collaboration with Hyundai Robotics, and technical leadership in Ecuador at ESPOL and Universidad Politécnica Salesiana. I specialize in decentralized multi-agent systems and implementing control laws for high-precision robotic platforms.

Research & Development
======
### Undergraduate Researcher | CoRAL Lab (Collaborative Robotics and AI), ESPOL
*Sep 2024 – Present | Guayaquil, Ecuador*
* **Lead author** of "Learning Functions for Specialized Task Allocation in Swarm Robotics", solving bottlenecks in autonomous swarm decision-making.
* Designed coordination algorithms for collective construction using **Lua and ARGoS** for large-scale experiments (10+ agents).
* Integrated **ROS/Gazebo** for hardware-in-the-loop validation.
* Leading the transition of the **QUPA robotic platform** (SCARA Kinematics) from theory to physical hardware, integrating 360° perception.
* Directly supervising undergraduate students in the development of autonomous navigation stacks and decentralized control architectures.

### Research Internship - Autonomous Systems | RISE Lab, Sungkyunkwan University
*Feb 2024 – May 2025 | Suwon, South Korea*
* **Hyundai Robotics Collaboration:** Optimized industrial motion planning and SLAM architectures for Hyundai platforms using **ROS 2 Foxy/Humble**.
* **Navigation Modeling:** Developed and validated navigation scenarios using Social Force Models (SFM) for safe human-robot interaction.

Patents & Publications
======
* **QUPA: Modular Robotic Platform for Swarm Construction** (Patent Pending): Developed with University College Dublin and Ph.D. David Garzón Ramos. Integrated a high-precision Parallel SCARA Manipulator, reducing unit costs from \$1,500 to \$450 USD.
* **"Deep Learning-based ECG Arrhythmia Classification"** (IEEE ICPRS 2023): Developed a CNN/ResNet architecture that achieved 99.32% accuracy. Published in IEEE Xplore.
